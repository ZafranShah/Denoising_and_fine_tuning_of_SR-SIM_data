# Evaluation of knowledge transfer for the denoising of super-resolution structured illumination microscopy data

In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have shown remarkable
performance in the denoising and reconstruction of super-resolved structured illumination
microscopy (SR-SIM) data. The potential for the generalization of these deep-learning models to
different real-world fluorescence microscopy data has, however, not yet been completely
explored. The question arises whether such CNN-based denoising methods are structure- and
noise-specific. Here, we apply transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to assess the
generalization capability of these methods to different domains, in particular super-resolved
microscopy images of different biological structures, before and after knowledge transfer. We
extensively investigate the performance of CNN-based denoising networks on data from different
domains (i.e. different biological structures) by applying transfer learning strategies, such as
direct transfer and fine-tuning. In the last step, we demonstrate that the fine-tuning approach is
more advantageous than the conventional training of CNN-based denoising methods to avoid
computational overhead.
